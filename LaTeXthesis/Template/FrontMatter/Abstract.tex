\noindent We know for a fact that opinions are formed through social interactions. Online communities offer public access to social disputes on controversial matters that allow the study and moderation of them. The majority of studies in social networks are based on the Friedkin-Johnsen model.
\\
\\
Users of online communities are receiving biased information that amplify their own viewpoints. This creates a fragmented community and users interact only with individuals that hold the same opinions. In this thesis we use a metric, the polarization index, to measure the polarization of a social graph.
\\
\\We try to reduce the polarization by connecting individuals. We propose new social connections between different and extreme opinions by following the intuition of the Friedkin-Johnsen model. 
\\
\\
Finally, probabilities are adopted to our heuristic algorithms that now make selections based on how probable is the acceptance of a recommendation of a new social connection.
