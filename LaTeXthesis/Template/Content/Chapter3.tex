\section{The Friedkin and Johnsen Model}
\label{sec:prem}

The Friedkin and Johnsen model is a very popular opinion dynamics model \cite{friedkin}. Each user has an internal and an external opinion. The internal opinion cannot change and is the specific opinion of an individual for a certain matter. On the other hand the expressed opinion is influenced by social interactions. The internal opinion of a user corresponds to the views that inherently holds for a controversial topic while the expressed opinion refers to the views that the user shares on a social network with their connections. The internal opinion of a user is denoted as $s_i$ and the expressed opinion as $z_i$. The expressed opinion $z_i$ is computed as a weighted average of the external opinions of the neighbourhood of the user. Let $G = (V,E)$ be a graph, and for a node $i$ let $N(i)$ be the neighbours of the node. We have that:
\\
\\
\begin{equation} 
	z_i = \frac{w_{ii}*si + \sum_{j \epsilon N(i) }{w_{ij}*z_j}} {w_{ii} + \sum_{j \epsilon N(i) }{w_{ij}}} 
\end{equation}

\noindent Let $s$ and $z$ denote the vectors of the internal and external opinions of all the nodes in the graph. There are two ways of obtaining the $z$ vector of opinions. The first is to use repeated averaging until the model converges. An equivalent way is by computing the following: if $L$ is the laplacian matrix of a graph $G=(V,E)$, and $I$ is the identity matrix, then $z=(L+I)^{-1}s$ \cite{bindel}. The vector values range from [-1,1]. Values closer to the range limits indicate extreme viewpoints, while values close to zero indicate moderation and neutrality.

\section{Measuring the Polarization}
\label{sec:meas}
\vspace{30pt}
We use the definition of the polarization index \cite{tsapMatakosTerzi}. Let $G = (V,E)$ be a connected undirected graph representing a network. Let $z$ be the vector of expressed opinions  for the whole network as computed by the Friedkin and Johnsen model. The polarization index $\pi(z)$ is defined as the measure of the distance of vector $z$  from the vector of all zeros, which corresponds to the neutral opinion. Specifically:
\vspace{25pt}


\begin{equation}
	\pi(z) = ||z||_{2}^2
\end{equation}
\vspace{25pt}

\noindent To make the polarization index independent of its network we can normalize it by dividing it with the length of the network size.

\section{Problem Definition}
\label{sec:problemDef}
We now define the problems that we will consider in this Thesis.
\\
\\
\noindent Problem 1 [k-Addition]. \noindent Let $G = (V,E)$ be a connected undirected graph representing a network and $k$ a given number of edges. Let $z$ be the vector of expressed opinions  for the whole network and $\pi(z) = ||z||_{2}^2$ the polarization index of this social graph. Let also $C \subseteq	V \times V$ set of edges that are not in the graph. We want to find a subset of $S \subseteq C$ of $k$ edges whose addition to a graph $G$ maximizes the reduction of the polarization index $\pi(z)$.
\\
\\
\noindent Problem 1 is trying to find edges that will minimize the polarization index. We must not take for granted that these edges will be accepted. 
For example a social media user could reject a new follow/friend request. This leads us to consider additions that have a probability of being accepted. For the following we assume that for each missing edge $(u,v)$ we have an estimate of the probability $P(u,v)$ that this edge is accepted if recommended.
\\
\\
\noindent Problem 2 [k-Addition-Expected]. Let $G = (V,E)$ be a connected undirected graph representing a network and $k$ a given number of edges. Let $z$ be the vector of expressed opinions  for the whole network and $\pi(z) = ||z||_{2}^2$ the polarization index of this social graph. Let also $C \subseteq V \times V$ set of edges that are not in the graph and $P(u,v)$ a probability that the edge addition $u,v$ is accepted. We want to find a subset of $S \subseteq C$ of $k$ edges whose addition to a graph $G$ maximizes the expected reduction of the polarization index.


\section{Monotonicity of the Problem}
\label{sec:monotonicity}

\begin{lemma}
The polarization index does not necessarily decrease after an edge addition between opposing views.
\end{lemma}

\vspace{20pt}
\noindent Proof:  We will  show this with a counter example. In the network~\ref{fig:p5} nodes 0, 2 and 3 have a value of $s_i=-1$, and nodes 1 and 4 have a value of $s_i=+1$. For both examples we assume that $w_{ii}=w_{ij}=w_{ji}=1$ and $n$ the number of nodes. We will now compute the polarization index of the original graph

\\

\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		z=(L+I)^{-1}s=
		\left(\begin{matrix}
		\frac{-27}{55} \\
		\frac{1}{55} \\
		\frac{-5}{11} \\
		\frac{-21}{55} \\
		\frac{17}{55}
		\end{matrix}\right),
		\qquad \qquad
		\pi(z)= 0.13785123966
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\\
\\
We will now add an edge between nodes $1\rightarrow3$. Note that these nodes have expressed opinions of opposite sign. We recompute the polarization index as follows.
\\
\\
\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		z=(L+I)^{-1}s=
		\left(\begin{matrix}
		\frac{-53}{99} \\
		\frac{-7}{99} \\
		\frac{-5}{11} \\
		\frac{-29}{99} \\
		\frac{35}{99}
		\end{matrix}\right),
		\qquad \qquad
		\pi(z) = 0.14180185695
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\\
\\
We can see an increase of the polarization index after adding this particular edge.
