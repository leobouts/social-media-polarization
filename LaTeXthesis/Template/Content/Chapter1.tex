\chapter{Introduction and the Theory Behind Polarization}
\label{ch:Introduction}


\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Objectives}

Real world events such as Brexit and the 2016 U.S. presidential elections give us a clear hint about the polarization our society is witnessing. 
\\
\\
Social media polarization has a strong effect on politics, opinion formation and how people interact with each other in a society. Users of social media are now receiving biased information that amplify their own viewpoints. 
\\
\\
Enclosed in their filter bubble, they will ignore everyone else and only acknowledge opinions that fit their own reality. In combination with fake news a malicious entity could use social media as a tool to polarize certain groups of people for their own interest. 
\clearpage

\noindent Our goal is to decrease the polarization by proposing new social connections. These additions are computed using heuristic algorithms.
\\
\\
\noindent In a real world setting, new social connections are not always accepted.  For example we would not accept friend requests from people we barely know.
 This is relevant with link prediction. Link prediction is the problem of predicting the existence of a link between two entities in a network in the future. For example the "People you may know" section on Facebook.		
\\		
\\		
Link prediction algorithms are based on how similar two different nodes are, what features they have in common, how are they connected to the rest of the network or how many other nodes are connected to a single node. 		
Link prediction is also used in recommendation systems and  information retrieval.
\\
\\
By using the acceptance probabilities of a link prediction model we can define the expected decrease of the polarization. For computing these probabilities we will use graph embeddings.

\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:motivation}

Polarization describes the division of people into two contrasting groups or sets of opinions or beliefs. The term is used in various domains such as politics and social studies.
In social media settings, users tend to join communities of like-minded individuals.
\\
\\
In these settings the opinions of the users are amplified and reinforced by the continuous  communication and recycling of the same view. These communities are referred to as echo chambers.
\\
\\
Inside an echo chamber users can easily find information that reinforces their existing opinion without being exposed to opposing views.
Echo chambers can be created where information is exchanged, whether itâ€™s online or in real life. 
\\
\\
On social media almost anyone can quickly find like-minded people and countless news sources. This has made echo chambers far more numerous and easy to fall into. 
\\
\\
Echo chambers online are referred to as filter bubbles. Filter bubbles are created by algorithms that keep track of the online behaviour of a user such as search histories, shopping activity and many more.
\\
\\
Social media will then use those algorithms to show content that is similar to what the user is already aligned with. This can lead users to adopt a more extreme version of their opinions. 


\section{Thesis Outline}
\label{sec:outline}

We begin by exploring the Friedkin and Johnsen Model. This model uses the terms of internal and external opinion. By repeated averaging and combining these two values we can get the opinion vector of the graph.
This is a vector that contains information about the opinions of the whole network. Then, by defining and computing the polarization index we can get an image of the social graph.
\\
\\
We then proceed and define our two problems. First, want to find the best $k$ edges that will lead to the greatest reduction of the polarization index. The second problem incorporates the acceptance probabilities.
We also observe that the addition of new edges between opposing opinions will not necessary decrease the polarization index  and prove it with a counter-example.
\\
\\
Our heuristics are based on the intuition that our model has the biggest decrease when we connect different and extreme opinions and classify them in two categories. 
\\
\\
In these two categories the heuristics do or do not recompute the graph structure after the addition of an edge. This is derived from the fact that when adding an edge to the network the structure of the graph changes.

\clearpage


\noindent The heuristics that consider network changes are the $Greedy$ the $FTGreedy$ and the $Expressed Opinion$. These three are then modified into a batch version that does not consider network changes.
\\
\\
We continue by using Graph Embeddings and the $Node2Vec$ algorithm to compute acceptance probabilities. We use these probabilities in a modified version of our heuristics to compute the expected decrease of the polarization index.
\\
\\
Our heuristics are applied in 6 datasets of various topics and compared with each other. The Greedy heuristics cannot run on graphs that contain a lot of nodes due to time limitations.

\section{Roadmap}
\label{sec:roadmap}

At chapter 2 we look into the related work around polarization and decreasing polarization. We see how polarization is measured, the relation of polarization and random walks and how polarization can be combined with disagreement and conflict. 
\\
\\
At chapter 3 we define the Friedkin and Johnsen model and the polarization index. We also define our 2 problems, the $k-Addition$ problem and the $k-Addition-Expected$. Then, we proceed to explore the monotonicity of the polarization index.
\\
\\
At chapter 4 we define our heuristics and at chapter 5 we continue by including acceptance probabilities in them.
\\
\\
At chapter 6 we take a look at our datasets and obtain the results of the polarization decrease for each heuristic in each dataset.
