In this section we  consider a greedy algorithm and some heuristics for reducing $\pi(z)$. All the heuristics use the intuition that connecting the most extreme opinions of each community can result in great reduction. 
When a new edge is introduced, the graph structure changes. This leads to changes in the opinion vector $z$.
The recomputation of the $z$ vector is expensive on time due to the computation of the inverse matrix in the $(L+I)^{-1}S$ formula.
This is why we consider two types of algorithms, those that recompute the $z$ vectors and those that do not.
All the heuristics run on $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$. This is due to the fact that they need to explore all edge combinations.

\section{Algorithms that recompute the opinion vector}
\label{sec:recomputeAlgos}

We begin with a Greedy algorithm. Greedy algorithms work in stages and during each stage a choice is made which is locally optimal.
The Greedy algorithm computes the decrease in $\pi(z)$ and selects the edge with the largest decrease every time.
\\
\\
After finding the best edge, the $Greedy$ algorithm adds this edge to the graph. This result in a change of the network structure.
Then a recomputation of the $z$ vector is happening and  the procedure is repeated.To reduce running times, we  use repeated averaging instead of computing the inverse matrix and limit the accuracy of the convergence.

\noindent A second heuristic we consider is the $FirstTopGreedy$. Let $X$ be the set of nodes of expressed opinions $\epsilon$ [-1,0) sorted by increasing order and $Y$ the set of nodes of expressed opinions $\epsilon$ (0,1] sorted by decreasing order. This heuristic use the first $k$ nodes of $X$ and $Y$, resulting in  a $k \times k$ smaller search space. This allows the $FirstTopGreedy$ to reduce the amount of time spend searching for the best edge to add. \noindent 
\\
\\
Last we consider two heuristics that choose edges based on the value of the expressed opinion of their nodes. The Distance of their opinions can be defined as $D=|z_u - z_v|$. This heuristic computes the distance between every edge candidate and then chooses to add the edge with the maximum distance.

\section{Algorithms that do not recompute the opinion vector}
\label{sec:norecomputeAlgo}

We continue by exploring some heuristics that do not consider the network changes and thus can run more easily in larger datasets.
Computing the $\pi(z)$ is an expensive operation due to the computation of the inverse matrix. At first we can see a variation of the $Greedy$ algorithm. Its implementation is similar to the $Greedy$. We compute the opinion vector only once and we sort the edges according to the decrease. Then we select the top $k$ edges.
\\
\\
We continue by using a variation of the $FirstTopGreedy$. The $FirstTopGreedyBatch$ heuristic. $FirsTopGreedy$  works exactly like $GreedyBatch$ with the difference that the opinion vector is not recomputed. Let $X$ be the set of nodes that their expressed opinions $\epsilon$ [-1,0) sorted by increasing order and $Y$ the set of nodes that their expressed opinions $\epsilon$ (0,1] sorted by decreasing order. This heuristic is taking the first $k$ nodes of $X$ and $Y$, resulting in $k \times k$ nodes.
